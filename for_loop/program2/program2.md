**Chat-gpt review and rating**
Your program successfully produces the desired output. It prints a pattern with numbers as described in the comments. Here's a brief review:

**Rating: 4.5/5**

*The logic is clear, and the code is concise. The use of continue to skip the printing of the "2nd line" is a good choice. However, for further improvement:*

*It's generally good practice to include comments explaining the purpose of the code or any complex logic. While your code is simple enough to understand without comments, adding comments can make it more maintainable for future readers or collaborators.*

*Consistent indentation is important for readability. Your code has some inconsistencies in indentation. Ensure that each block of code inside a loop or conditional statement is indented consistently.*
