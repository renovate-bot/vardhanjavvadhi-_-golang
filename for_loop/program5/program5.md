**Chat-gpt review and rating:-**

*Your program is a simple and effective way to check whether a given number is prime or not using a for loop. Here's a brief review:*

**Rating: 4/5**

*The logic is clear, and the code is concise. However, for further improvement:*

*It's good practice to include comments explaining the purpose of the code or any complex logic. Adding comments can make the code more understandable, especially for those who might be reading it for the first time.*

*Consider adding input validation to ensure that the user enters a positive integer. Currently, the program doesn't handle cases where the user might input a non-positive integer or a non-integer.*
