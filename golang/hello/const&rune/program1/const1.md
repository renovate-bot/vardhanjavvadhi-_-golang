Your Go program using constants looks well-structured and functions correctly. Here's a quick review and rating:

## Review:

Constant Naming: Good job on naming your constant id with an informative name.

String Constant: Using a string constant name is also appropriate. Just be aware that in Go, the convention is to use camel case for variable names. So, it could be name or employeeName instead of Name.

Print Statements: Clear and concise use of fmt.Println and Printf to output the messages.

Formatting in Printf: The use of %d in Printf for the id constant is suitable for displaying an integer.

## Rating:

I would rate your program as 4.5/5. It's well-organized, uses constants appropriately, and delivers the expected output.
