**Review by Chatgpt:-**
*Your code is functional and achieves the goal of printing the multiplication table of a given number. Here are some suggestions for improvement:*

User Input Validation:
*Consider adding input validation to ensure that the user enters a valid number. If the user enters a non-numeric value, the program may behave unexpectedly. You can use fmt.Scan and check for errors to handle invalid input more robustly.*

Formatting for Printf:
*Consider adding a newline character \n at the end of the Printf statement to separate the output from the prompt. It will make the output more visually appealing.*

Consistent Formatting:
*Maintain consistent indentation and spacing for better readability.*
