*Chatgpt review and rating*:-

Your code demonstrates the use of the switch statement in Go with an optional statement and expression. The switch is based on the value of the month variable, and each case corresponds to a different month, printing the corresponding abbreviation.

The code is well-structured and concise. The use of the := operator in the switch statement is a good choice for declaring and initializing the month variable in the scope of the switch block.

Here are some points to consider:

The code is straightforward and achieves its purpose effectively.

Good use of the fmt.Println statements within each case to print the month abbreviations.

The default case handles the situation where the value of month doesn't match any of the defined cases.

Overall, your code looks clean and follows best practices. I would rate it 4.5 out of 5. Great job
